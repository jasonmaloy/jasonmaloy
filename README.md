ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jasonmaloy

This is a quick little page for me to store some bits of code I've written over the years so I can keep track! Organizing to be done...

Currently stored:
monte.py: A program that approximates Pi via a Monte Carlo method.
primes.py: A quick little program that lists a given amount of prime numbers, and tells you how many prime pairs (prime numbers that differ by 2) are among them.
MyPriorityQueue.java: A heap-based implementation of a Priority Queue. For my Data Structures course.
peon.c (in hw9): A UNIX shell coded in C.
